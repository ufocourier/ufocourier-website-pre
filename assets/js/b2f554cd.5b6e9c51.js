With our platform anyone can be a courier.\\n\\nThe idea for the platform came from personal need. Thousands and millions of Ukrainians living abroad want to send packages to family back home. However, with the use of established logistics service providers, this is a costly and lengthy process. A number of individual drivers have recognized this and are already offering rides, organized through social networks.\\n\\nWe would like to offer the above groups a platform from which everyone involved can benefit without restricting them.\\n\\nOksana, experienced in business and with special insights into the logistics industry will be our CEO and Pawel, experienced software developer and consultant will be our CTO."}]}')}}]);
